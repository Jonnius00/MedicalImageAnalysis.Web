1. Building the image upload and display page in Razor.

  ├── Pages/                 # Razor Pages (UI)

  └── Utils/                 # Shared helpers (image conversion, metrics, timing)
  Keeps algorithm logic decoupled from UI. This ensures I can later reuse the same core logic (or mirror it closely) in your second language. 

  # Essential image & math libraries and minimal versions.
  dotnet add package MathNet.Numerics --version 5.0.0
  dotnet add package fo-dicom --version 5.1.1
  dotnet add package SixLabors.ImageSharp --version 3.1.5
  ? dotnet add package NIfTI.NET --version 1.0.0
  ? dotnet add package ML.NET --version 2.0.0

2. Core Functional Modules.
  Implement these as services or stateless functions:

  A. Data Loading
  Support common medical formats: DICOM (via fo-dicom ), NIfTI (via custom or NIfTI.NET ), and standard images (PNG/JPG).
  Load into a unified internal representation (e.g., float[,,] for 3D volumes or Bitmap for 2D slices).

  B. Preprocessing: PCA.
  Use Math.NET Numerics for matrix operations.
  Implement PCA on image patches or flattened slices (clarify dimensionality based on use case).
  Output: Transformed data + explained variance.

  C. Clustering.
  Start with K-means (available in Math.NET or ML.NET).
  Allow user to choose number of clusters.
  Output: Label map per pixel/voxel.

  D. Segmentation Algorithms.
  Implement as interchangeable strategies:
  Thresholding: Otsu, adaptive, manual.
  Region Growing: Seed-based, 4/8-connectivity.
  Watershed: Use morphological operations (consider ImageSharp for 2D or custom 3D).
  Output: Binary mask or labeled regions.?
    ⚠️ Note: Medical images are often 3D, but many libraries are 2D-only. Decide early: slice-by-slice 2D or true 3D processing? 
  
3. Visualization & Comparison. 
  Since Razor Pages is server-rendered, use client-side JS for interactivity:

  Use Canvas or SVG for overlaying segmentations.
  Libraries: OpenSeadragon (for zoomable medical images), or lightweight Leaflet with image overlays.
  Side-by-side or toggle views for algorithm comparison.
  Display performance metrics: execution time, Dice coefficient (if ground truth available), cluster stats.

 4. Pipeline Execution & State Management.
  Model a Pipeline as a sequence of steps (e.g., Load → PCA → KMeans → Watershed).
  Store pipeline configuration in session or as a serializable object.
  Allow users to save/load pipelines (JSON).
  Log execution time per step for performance comparison. 

 5. Preparing for Cross-Language Consistency.
  Even though project is starting in C#/.NET:

  Document algorithm parameters precisely (e.g., “K-means: 5 clusters, 100 iterations, Euclidean distance”).
  Use deterministic seeds for reproducibility.
  Define input/output contracts (e.g., “Segmentation returns integer label map same size as input”).
  Later, your second implementation (e.g., Python with PyQt or Flask) must match these specs exactly.
